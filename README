Flowable external worker spring boot starter

This spring boot starter will make life easier when using External Tasks in Flowable. This starter will do the pulling and handling of the status of the jobs for you.

How to use : 
 
 Import the maven dependency
	<dependency>
		<groupId>com.xti.flowable</groupId>
		<artifactId>flowable-externalworker-client-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
		<version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
	</dependency>
 
  In your application properties : 
 
	- set the flowable-engine api url with the key flowable.external.url i.e. : flowable.external.url = http://localhost:8080/external-job-api
	- set the worker ID with the key flowable.external.workerId
 
 To implement the worker : 

- On the method that will handle the job for a specific topic, put the annotation @FlowableWorker
	Parameters from the annotation: 
	topic : (mandatory) topic to get the jobs from
	lockDuration : the time the job will be locked by the worker. Format is ISO-8601 duration. i.e. 10 minutes will translate to PT10M. The default value is 10 minutes
	maxTasks : the maximum number of tasks that will be acquired. Default value is 10
	numberOfRetries : The number of retries if an optimistic lock exception occurs during acquiring. Default is 10
	scopeType : Only acquire jobs with the given scope type.
   
- The method should take a AcquiredJob as parameter. This method should define the logic to handle the acquiredJob.
  Methods to manipulate the jobs : 
   complete
   bpmnError
   cmmnTerminate
   fail
   
- The method is automatically called when a acquiredJob is available.
